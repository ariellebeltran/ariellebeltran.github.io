1. First critique: Not user friendly enough, for e.g. at the landing page when showing the list of projects, the user doesn't know to click on to the image or title to go inside the page.
2. Second critique: Site looks too plain, looks really general? Like they wanted to see what the portfolios of for e.g. graphic designers look like and how they are style. I think they also wanted to see some information that stands out to companys related to that career.
